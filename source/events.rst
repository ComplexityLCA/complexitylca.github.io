Introducing complexity-oriented methods into life-cycle thinking enhancing the study of sustainable socio-technical systems

    `EVENT RESOURCES (slides, videos) <https://github.com/ComplexityLCA/complexity-lca-events/tree/main/07-06-2024>`_

The initiative was launched with this webinar with more than 100 participants from Europe, Asia, and Amerias. Three keynote presentations by three experienced researchers in the field were meant to provide an introductory view of the main characteristics, benefits, and difficulties of using complexity-oriented approaches in combination with LCA studies. 

**Agent-based modelling and simulation for the circular economy** by Julien Walzberg, PhD (link to slide)

Julien Walzberg is a researcher from the Strategic Energy Analysis Center of the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) in the United States. He works on circular economy and sustainability research projects including the integration of agent-based modeling and simulation and life cycle assessment.

**Addressing Algorithmic complexity and computational challenges in linking ABM to LCA** by 
Tomás Navarrete Gutiérrez, PhD (link to slide)

Tomás Navarrete Gutiérrez works at the Environmental Research & Innovation (ERIN) department of the Luxembourg Institute of Science and Technology (LIST). He does research in Agent-Based Simulation, Computer Communications (Networks) and Computational LCA.
    
**Applications of agent-based modelling in energy transitions for industrial networks and urban systems** by Koen Van Dam, PhD (link to slides)

Research Fellow at Imperial College London's Urban Energy Systems group at the Faculty of Engineering  specialized in agent-based models for city systems. He utilizes spatial and temporal data from various sectors and scales, particularly energy and transport, providing valuable decision support for designing new services, technologies, and policies. Having worked on national and international sustainability projects, he is currently part of the FCDO-funded Climate Compatible Growth (CCG) programme and member of the secretariat of the Energy Transition Council (ETC) working in close collaboration with the UK's Department of Energy Security and Net Zero (DESNZ) to deliver coordination and technical assistance in partner countries.

The webinar was concluded with participatory discussion to list out challenges we face in our complexity-oriented life cycle research and expectations to the initiative. (link to slide)
