Life-Cycle Thinking for Complex Systems Initiative
==================================================

Welcome to the initiative!
==========================

We are an open initiative consisting of researchers who are industrial ecologists, computer scientists, and social scientists, aiming to integrate complexity-oriented methods into life cycle thinking (LCT) approach. 
Many of us apply agent-based modelling (ABM) techniques in combination with life cycle assessment (LCA), input-output analysis (IOA), and material flow analysis (MFA) to explore and assess the sustainability of socio-techno-ecological systems. 
We provide opportunities for networking, research collaboration, and methodological development. 
Our application areas vary, including circular economy, industrial symbiosis, construction, urban planning, agriculture and food.
